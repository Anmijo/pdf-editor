Code to edit, scale and merge specific study material at the user's request

### Project Description
In high school I was in the IGCSE school system. My friend and I decided to start this initiative to make past exam papers and solutions more accessible and available. We started this project to provide students with printed Past Papers(past exam questions and solutions) in booklets organized by year, sessions, subjects, and much more. In less than a year we were able to reach hundreds of students. However, the entire process was comprised of us manually downloading the Past Papers, scaling them, merging them, and printing them.  

This project is an attempt to revive that initiative, while also making it more automated and easy. Now instead of manually merging and scaling the Past Paper files, this project will ask the user for the desired subject, year, and sessions and it will do that all automatically.
